# New Game Plus

I'm starting over, as much as that's even possible. Rough collection of things I want to try and do:

## Big arcs

- non-coerciveness. What does my life look like when I avoid doing things parts of me veto?
  - increase into not-doing / allowing
- investigate shadows. There are so many! Can I eat some?
  - all cringe points to a shadow, go in for the pain & self-compassion
- figure out my values


## Smol things

all of these are secondary to my investigation of non-coerciveness

- Learn the area. Be outside a lot.
- Exercise a lot for a while, see if I can get used to it.
- Decorate the new flat.
- Plants in the new flat!
- Stream games. Stream stuff.
- Take up space. Move in space.
  - Dancing? Could I â€¦ dance? Or martial arts. Play with my body while I have time.
  - be aware of (your|a) rhythm
- Figure out [my meta level](https://twitter.com/Malcolm_Ocean/status/1310984762522243074)
- continue morning pages
- try all the things: how else would you know what you want?
- try scary and brave things. public creativity
- try weird thing, like s. or o. would. pay for a coversong. plan an elaborate trip.
- close all tabs, achieve [statelessness](https://freedom.brick.do/7ac2607d-8e94-4f59-b5e8-8ceeb2f97b7c)
- do the narratively most interesting thing. experiment with different narratives.

## ground rules

1. Radiate intent freely and honestly.
2. Do not treat people as things.
3. When you flinch from it, turn towards it.
4. Embody your vibe relentlessly.

*but also* rules are for suckers, playfulness mwahahaha. Do the narratively most interesting thing.

## my mind

- you are enough: clever, playful, kind, occasionally wise.
  - (remember? you like yourself)
- you like to feel anxious because it protects you from harm – but take it easy, remember playfulness, leave the anxiety for the important things. stop performing scared.
- remember you're safe. feel safe. things will fall into place.
- you have agency ffs
- sleep, movement, and take your damn hormones.
- there are people who like you, and there are even some people who love you.
- you like to cycle through projects and tools. don't fight the process, move fluently. it's a dance.
- anger is a strength. remember the bad thing and be angry. he dared to touch you.
- there's a fire in you and don't you forget
- **if you flinch from it, turn towards it**

## role models and others

imagine what the following would think about your situation and you'll feel things.

- esme weatherwax
- nanny ogg (of course)
- miles vorkosigan (sigh)
- cordelia naismith, though honestly … aral and jole too
- friedrich nietzsche
- sam vimes
- ursula k leguin
- red and blue (time war)
- junker nils von eka/jonathan
- the old jesuit
- 

## embodiment

- posture is reflection. remember the hat full of sky and you're good.
- cue: spark joy
- asking your body nicely to do something is a powerful cheat code
- cue: radiate intent
- consider how you dress
- cue: rate yourself out of 10 ("I'm a 10")

## people, communication

- polarise early when you can afford it. trust that it'll work out.
- you're good at people. don't know why, but it feels like magic
- you hate to think about phone calls, you hate to prepare for meeting people, but you're fluent and happy while being in the situation. maybe cut out the first part.
- go for 1:1 communications more often than your intuition says. it pays off. [glare at people in private](https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening)

## friendships

- keep up with your friends when you have the energy
- make a list of people you admire, talk to them about shared interests if you have the opportunity
- try weirdness. trust them

## relationships

- shared silliness is important
- as is patience and somebody into communication
- you find relationships when you're not looking, and you can always flirt with anybody
- **flirting** means "you act "as if" the other person were attracted to you (and you them!) and you're allowed to do anything except explicitly draw attention to the fact." [via](https://twitter.com/pervexists69/status/1298374939490230272)
- you're still processing four emotionally unfulfilled years. grief before new relationships. flirting is still allowed tho

## minds generally

- some people have an inner monologue, some don't, both are weirded out.

## productivity

- "moving" is the ground state, "done" is not a goal. tasks are an infinite stream. rest is not a reward. the reward is moving fluently and competently among stimulating steams. **action is not damage**. [via](http://mindingourway.com/rest-in-motion/)
- "I should" no. do what's best. embody your want.
- you need to feel safe. make yourself safe. visualise utterly catastrophic worst cases and how you'll be safe.
- if you're not doing anything productive anyways, read one of [these](http://mindingourway.com/guilt/)
- apply the [meta protocol](https://meditationstuff.wordpress.com/protocol-documents/protocol-analysis/) because verbalising
- productivity out of spite is valid
- consider: [goals vs values](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4zGWYzh6ZiG85b2z/the-curse-of-the-counterfactual). not just what, but how.
- just announcing to the air what's happening/not happening/what you'd like is another cheat code

## self-improvement

- ha.
- whatever you're going for: it's in you, all you have to do is let go (or worst case: shape it into good embodiment)
- if anything, think bigger, soar
- hate to say this, but if you're alternating between two extremes, zoom out and go for synthesis (sorry)

## problems

- [destruction](http://notebook.ohuiginn.net/destructive-character/) is a way to solve problems
- focusing or feeding your demons work well on structual problems, but less if they are extreme
- deep breaths and playfulness. sorry, you don't want to hear that, but it's true.
- you chose the problem. appreciate this.
- have you tried being into it? (spoiler: you have.)
- cue: make it harder
- cue: make it trivial (aka: what does mastery look like?)
- what is the movement that describes the problem?
- cue: accelerator vs brake
- cue: [is–ought](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4zGWYzh6ZiG85b2z/the-curse-of-the-counterfactual)
- cue: where are you?

## learning

- you learn things by doing them. a lot.
  - etudes. [codekata](http://codekata.com/). drills.
- no need to be stupid about it.
- being clever won't absolve you of doing things a lot.
- spaced repetition applies to more than default learning subjects.
- you like to feel overwhelmed by learning new concepts. breathe and move into playfulness.

## religion

- you miss religion, you need religion, find a way to satisfy that
  - [build a religion](https://twitter.com/RoqaVuk/status/1296926657622749185)
  - but also, building a religion probably only works when you have several centuries to wait it out
- you can pray without a god
- kneel


## introspection tech

- focusing
- feeding your demons
- [change belief tech](https://twitter.com/WeftOfSoul/status/1298878494978592769)

## introspection results

- **fear of strength / productivity / losing weight / doing things**: a black net over my chest and throat, choking me. it *wants* me to curl up, freeze, hide. it *needs* to make sure nobody can see me or talk about me. then, it can open its wings, become tall and wide. if i feed it this warm strength, it turns into a heavy rubbery black cape. "I will protect you from people. I will turn their glances into admiration. I will turn their words into stunned silence. I will guard your back." it makes me look badass and will always come when i feed it warmth. [images](https://twitter.com/RoqaVuk/status/1294951480429084673)
- if you separate along sub/dom lines, the sub's been running my life and the dom's been hidden away, which is not an ideal separation of household tasks – topping from the bottom is draining. let him out. (think about your transition)

## gender

- transitioning was a choice, and it was not inevitable. it was a right choice, and it was the best choice long before i considered it.

## aesthetic and art

- images: you have a strong visual aesthetic, use it. it may seem hard to reconcile parts of it, but you'll manage
  - bilibin
  - bauhaus, the sleek version
  - klemke
  - your image collection
- bodies
  - [male dancer appreciation](https://twitter.com/RoqaVuk/status/1276524468341477379)
  
  
## social media

- "do they spark joy"
- block and mute once you consider it
- people notice that you're calm and they like it. keep at it.

## random shit i don't want to forget

- [bullying pays off for the bully](https://twitter.com/HarryTWalton/status/1291305580259348481)

## quotes and good twetes

- i struggled with some demons / they were middle class and tame / i didn't know i had permission to murder & to maim
- ja! ich weiß woher ich stamme / ungesättigt, gleich der flamme / glühe und verzehr ich mich / licht ist alles, was ich fasse / kohle alles, was ich lasse / flamme bin ich sicherlich
- the burning star thing
- pale blue dot, you know what
